# Email Notification System

## Understanding the Email Notification System

The volunteer management system includes a comprehensive email notification system that automatically communicates with volunteers and administrators throughout the task lifecycle. This system ensures timely communication and efficient task coordination.

**Technology Foundation:**
The email notification system is powered by **WP Mail SMTP** plugin, which ensures reliable email delivery and professional communication from the kcnseniors.coop domain. Email content is dynamically generated using data from **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)** to provide personalized, relevant information to each recipient.

**Email System Scope:**
This email notification system is exclusively used for the volunteer management system. All other email communications (contact forms, newsletters, etc.) use separate systems.

For detailed technical implementation, see [ACF & WP Mail SMTP Integration](/docs/custom-development/acf-wp-mail-smtp-integration).
