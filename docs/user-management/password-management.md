# Password Management & Security

Strong password policies and security measures are essential for protecting your WordPress site from unauthorized access. This guide covers comprehensive password management strategies and security implementations for the KCN Seniors website.

## Password Policy Requirements

### Strong Password Guidelines

| Requirement | Specification | Rationale |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Minimum Length** | 12 characters recommended | Resists brute force attacks |
| **Character Mix** | Letters (upper/lower), numbers, special characters | Increases complexity |
| **Uniqueness** | Never reuse passwords across accounts | Prevents credential stuffing |
| **Generation** | Use WordPress auto-generated passwords or password managers | Ensures randomness |

### Password Strength Assessment

| Strength Level | Characteristics | Security Level |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Weak** | < 8 characters, common words, no special characters | ❌ Easily compromised |
| **Fair** | 8-11 characters, mixed case, some numbers | ⚠️ Moderate protection |
| **Strong** | 12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols | ✅ Good protection |
| **Very Strong** | 16+ characters, truly random, unique | 🔒 Excellent protection |

## Password Management Best Practices
