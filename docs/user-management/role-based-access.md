# Role-Based Access Control

Role-based access control (RBAC) allows you to control what users can and cannot do on your site by assigning different roles with specific capabilities. This system ensures that users have appropriate access levels while maintaining security and protecting sensitive content.

## Understanding Capabilities

Capabilities define specific actions a user can perform. Each capability represents a discrete permission that can be granted or denied to roles.

### Core Capability Categories

| Category | Description | Common Capabilities | KCN Seniors Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Content Management** | Post and page operations | read, edit_posts, publish_posts, delete_posts | Content creation and editing |
| **User Management** | User account operations | edit_users, delete_users, create_users | User administration |
| **System Management** | Administrative functions | manage_options, activate_plugins, switch_themes | Site configuration |
| **Media Management** | File and media operations | upload_files, edit_files, delete_files | Media library access |
| **Comment Management** | Comment moderation | moderate_comments, edit_comment, delete_comment | Community engagement |

### Capability Hierarchy

**Understanding Permission Levels:**

**System Capabilities** (Highest Level - Most Powerful)
- Complete website control and administration
- Plugin and theme management
- System settings and configuration

**User Management Capabilities**
- Create, edit, and delete user accounts
- Manage user roles and permissions
- User administration functions

**Content Management Capabilities**
- Create, edit, publish, and delete content
- Manage posts, pages, and media
- Content organization and structure

**Media Management Capabilities**
- Upload and manage files
- Organize media library
- Control media access

**Comment Management Capabilities**
- Moderate and manage comments
- Control commenting permissions
- Community engagement tools

**Basic Read Capabilities** (Lowest Level - Most Basic)
- View website content
- Basic navigation and interaction
- Public information access

## Role Hierarchy and Permissions

### Content Access Levels

The hierarchical role system provides cumulative access to content, ensuring that higher-level roles inherit all permissions from lower-level roles.

#### Access Level Structure

| Level | Role | Content Access | Additional Features |
|-------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Level 1** | Public | General website information | Basic site navigation |
| **Level 2** | Subscriber | Enhanced logged-in features | Commenting abilities |
| **Level 3** | Member | Premium resources and content | Member-only events |
| **Level 4** | Volunteer | Volunteer tools and resources | Training materials |
| **Level 5** | Administrator 2 | Administrative content | Reports and analytics |
| **Level 6** | Administrator | Complete system access | All features and settings |

## Implementing Access Control

### Content Protection Setup

#### Post and Page Protection

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1. **Edit Content**
   - Navigate to the post or page you want to protect
   - Click "Edit" to open the editor

2. **Access Control Configuration**
   - Look for the "Access" meta box in the sidebar
   - Select the roles that should have access to this content
   - Multiple roles can be selected for broader access

3. **Save and Test**
   - Update or publish the content
   - Test access with different user accounts
   - Verify that unauthorized users cannot access the content

#### Protection Examples

| Content Type | Protected Roles | Access Level | Implementation |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Member Events** | Member, Volunteer, Administrator 2, Administrator | Level 3+ | Restrict to member roles and above |
| **Volunteer Training** | Volunteer, Administrator 2, Administrator | Level 4+ | Restrict to volunteer roles and above |
| **Administrative Reports** | Administrator 2, Administrator | Level 5+ | Restrict to management roles |
| **Public Information** | All roles + visitors | Level 1 | No restrictions needed |

### Category Protection

#### Category-Level Access Control

**Implementation Process:**

1. **Access Category Settings**
   - Go to `Posts → Categories`
   - Find the category you want to protect
   - Click "Edit" to modify category settings

2. **Set Access Permissions**
   - Choose roles that can view content in this category
   - Apply protection to all posts within the category
   - Save changes to implement protection

3. **Verify Protection**
   - Test with different user accounts
   - Ensure category archives are properly protected
   - Check that individual posts inherit category protection

#### Category Protection Benefits

| Benefit | Description | Implementation Advantage |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Bulk Protection** | Protect entire content categories at once | Efficient management |
| **Organized Access** | Group content by access level | Clear content organization |
| **Easy Management** | Centralized access control | Single point of administration |

| **Volunteer Navigation** | Volunteers and above | Level 4+ | Role-based visibility |
| **Admin Navigation** | Administrator 2 and above | Level 5+ | Role-based visibility |

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create Role-Specific Menus**
   - Create separate menus for different user types
