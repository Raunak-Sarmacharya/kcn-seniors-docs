## Content Creation Workflow

### WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg)

The blog uses the modern **WordPress Block Editor** introduced in WordPress 5.0. This replaces the old Classic Editor with a block-based approach.

#### What Are Blocks?
**Blocks** are individual content elements that combine to create rich, engaging posts. Each paragraph, image, heading, or multimedia element is a separate block.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Visual Content Creation** - See exactly how content will appear
- **Modular Design** - Mix and match different content types
- **Mobile-Responsive** - Automatically adapts to all devices
- **No Coding Required** - User-friendly interface

#### Block Editor Interface

The Block Editor provides a modern interface with:
- **Top Toolbar**: Block inserter, undo/redo, settings menu
- **Title Area**: Post title input field
- **Content Area**: Main editing space for blocks
- **Settings Panel**: Categories, tags, featured image, discussion settings

## Content Organization

### Categories - Broad Content Groups

Categories provide hierarchical organization for your blog content.

#### Category Management:
- **Location**: `Posts > Categories` in WordPress Dashboard
- **Hierarchy**: Support parent/child relationships
- **URL Structure**: Creates category archive pages
- **SEO Impact**: Helps search engine organization

#### Creating Categories:

Navigate to: Posts > Categories
Add New Category:
- **Name**: "Community News" (Display name)
- **Slug**: "community-news" (URL-friendly version)
- **Parent Category**: [Optional] (For subcategories)
- **Description**: "Latest community updates and announcements"

#### Best Practices:
- **Broad Topics**: Use for general subject areas
- **Limit Categories**: 5-15 total categories maximum
- **Unique Names**: Each category must have unique name
- **SEO-Friendly Slugs**: Use hyphens, lowercase, descriptive

**Example Category Structure:**
Community News
- Events & Activities
- Member Spotlights
- Announcements

Health & Wellness
- Fitness Tips
- Nutrition Advice
- Mental Health

Co-op Living
- Housing Updates
- Maintenance Tips
- Community Guidelines

### Tags - Specific Keywords

Tags are non-hierarchical labels for specific topics within posts.

#### Tag Management:
- **Location**: `Posts > Tags` in WordPress Dashboard
- **No Hierarchy**: Tags are flat, no parent/child
- **Cross-Category**: Can span multiple categories
- **Keyword Focus**: Specific terms and phrases

#### Creating Tags:

Navigate to: Posts > Tags
Add New Tag:
- **Name**: "gardening tips" (Specific keyword)
- **Slug**: "gardening-tips" (Auto-generated)
- **Description**: "Posts about gardening advice and techniques"

#### Tag Strategy:
- **Specific Keywords**: Focus on detailed topics
- **5-10 Tags per Post**: Avoid tag spam
- **Consistent Usage**: Reuse tags across related posts
- **Reader Benefits**: Help users find related content

## Role-Based Comment System

### Comment Access Control

The blog implements **role-based commenting** where only logged-in users can leave comments on blog posts.

#### Comment Permissions:

| User Type | Comment Access | Moderation |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Logged-out Visitors** | Cannot comment | N/A |
| **Logged-in Members** | Can comment | Auto-approved |
| **Subscribers** | Can comment | Auto-approved |
| **Volunteers** | Can comment | Auto-approved |
| **Administrators** | Can comment | Always approved |

#### Comment Settings Configuration

**WordPress Dashboard Path**: `Settings > Discussion`

Discussion Settings:
- **Default Post Settings**:
  - "Allow people to submit comments on new posts" (Enabled)
  - "Users must be registered and logged in to comment" (Enabled)

- **Other Comment Settings**:
  - "Comment author must have previously approved comment" (Enabled)
  - "Hold a comment in the queue if it contains 2 or more links" (Enabled)

- **Email Settings**:
  - "Email me whenever anyone posts a comment" (Enabled)
  - "Email me whenever a comment is held for moderation" (Enabled)

### Technical Implementation

The role-based commenting system is implemented through WordPress core settings. In the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to Settings > Discussion and enable "Users must be registered and logged in to comment."

For advanced customization, custom code can be added to restrict commenting to specific roles, but this is typically not necessary for most implementations.
