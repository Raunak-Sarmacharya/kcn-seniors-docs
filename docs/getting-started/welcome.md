3. **Session Management**
   - Monitor active user sessions
   - Log out inactive sessions automatically
   - Track login attempts and suspicious activity

### Role-Based Access Control

Role-based access control (RBAC) allows you to control what users can and cannot do on your site by assigning different roles with specific capabilities.

#### Understanding Capabilities

Capabilities define specific actions a user can perform. Examples include:

- read - View content
- edit_posts - Edit posts
- publish_posts - Publish posts
- delete_posts - Delete posts
- manage_options - Access settings
- edit_users - Edit user accounts

#### Role Hierarchy and Permissions

##### Content Access Levels

The hierarchical role system provides cumulative access to content:

   - Accessible to everyone (all roles + visitors)
   - General website information, news, basic resources

#### Implementing Access Control

##### Registration Process Options

**Current KCN Seniors Process (Admin-Only Registration)**

- Membership applications submitted via website forms (Elementor)
- In-person meetings required for membership approval
- Cash payments handled during in-person meetings
- Process: Form Submission → Admin Review → In-Person Meeting → Cash Payment → Manual Account Creation → Role Assignment

**Alternative Options for Future Consideration:**

**Option 1: Approval-Based Registration**
- Users could create their own accounts but remain as "Subscriber" 
- Admin approval process for role upgrade to "Member"
- Still requires in-person payment verification
- Process: Self-Registration → Admin Review → In-Person Payment → Role Upgrade

**Option 2: Online Payment Integration**
- Future enhancement could include online payment processing
- Automatic role assignment after payment verification
- Requires payment gateway setup and security measures
- Process: Registration → Online Payment → Automatic Role Assignment

#### Custom Registration Forms

For enhanced registration processes:

##### Using Elementor Forms (Membership Applications)

1. Create registration forms with custom fields
2. Collect additional member information
3. Manual review and account creation
4. Integration with payment systems for memberships

##### Member-Specific Registration

**Current KCN Seniors Process:**

1. **Membership Application Form**:
   - Elementor form embedded on membership page
   - Collects applicant information and interests
   - Form submissions sent to administrators for review
   - No automatic account creation

2. **Manual Account Creation Process**:
   - Administrator reviews form submission
   - Creates user account manually with "Subscriber" role
   - Arranges in-person meeting for orientation and payment
   - Manually upgrades role to "Member" after payment received

3. **Member Communication**:
   - Welcome email sent after role upgrade
   - Member handbook and guidelines provided
   - Information about member-only events and resources

#### Email Notifications

##### Automated Communications

Configure email notifications for:

1. **New User Registration**:
