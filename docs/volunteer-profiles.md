# Managing Volunteer Profiles

## Understanding Volunteer Profiles

Volunteer profiles are the foundation of the automated task matching system. Each volunteer's profile contains their skills, interests, and availability information that the system uses to match them with appropriate tasks.

### Profile Components

**Essential Information:**
- **Personal Details**: Name, contact information, emergency contacts
- **Skills and Interests**: ACF tags representing volunteer capabilities
- **Availability**: General availability patterns and preferences
- **Experience Level**: Years of service and areas of expertise
- **Preferences**: Types of tasks they prefer or want to avoid

**System Integration:**
- **WordPress User Account**: Base profile information
- **ACF Tags**: Skill categories and specializations
- **User Metadata**: Stored skill IDs for efficient matching
- **Role Assignment**: Volunteer role with appropriate permissions

## Setting Up Volunteer Profiles

### Administrative Profile Creation

**1. Access User Management:**
- Navigate to WordPress dashboard
- Go to Users → All Users
- Click "Add New" to create volunteer account

**2. Basic Account Setup:**
- **Username**: Create unique username for volunteer
- **Email**: Primary contact email address
- **Password**: Generate secure password
- **Role**: Assign "Volunteer" role

**3. Profile Information:**
- **First Name**: Volunteer's first name
- **Last Name**: Volunteer's last name
- **Contact Information**: Phone number and address
- **Emergency Contact**: Backup contact information

### ACF Skill Tag Assignment

**1. Locate Volunteer Tags Section:**
- Scroll down to "Volunteer Tags" field in user profile
- This field uses Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) taxonomy
- Multiple skills can be selected for each volunteer

**2. Assign Skills and Interests:**
- Check all relevant skill categories for the volunteer
- Common categories include:
  - **Transportation**: Driving, errands, appointments
  - **Home Maintenance**: Light repairs, yard work, cleaning
  - **Technology Support**: Computer help, phone assistance
  - **Social Visits**: Companionship, check-ins, visits
  - **Administrative**: Office work, data entry, phone calls
  - **Event Support**: Setup, coordination, cleanup
  - **Professional Services**: Nursing, legal, financial advice

**3. Save Profile:**
- Click "Update User" to save changes
- System automatically stores skills in user metadata
- Volunteer is now eligible for matching tasks

## Profile Management

### Updating Volunteer Information

**Regular Profile Updates:**
- **Contact Information**: Keep phone and email current
- **Skills and Interests**: Add or remove skill tags as needed
- **Availability**: Update availability patterns
- **Preferences**: Modify task preferences

**Administrative Process:**
1. Access volunteer's user profile
2. Update relevant information fields
3. Modify ACF skill tags as needed
4. Save changes to update system

### Skill Tag Management

**Adding New Skills:**
- Navigate to Volunteer Tasks → Tags (Volunteer Tags)
- Create new skill categories as needed
- Assign to appropriate volunteers
- Update task requirements to include new skills

**Removing Skills:**
- Uncheck skill tags from volunteer profiles
- System will no longer match them for those skills
- Consider impact on existing task assignments

**Skill Categories:**
- **Primary Skills**: Core volunteer capabilities
- **Secondary Skills**: Additional areas of expertise
- **Specializations**: Specific technical or professional skills
- **Preferences**: Tasks volunteers enjoy or want to avoid

## Profile Integration with Task Matching

### How Matching Works

**Skill-Based Matching:**
- System reads volunteer skill tags from profiles
- Compares with task skill requirements
- Matches volunteers with appropriate tasks
- Sends notifications to qualified volunteers

**Matching Criteria:**
- **Exact Matches**: Volunteer has exact skill required
- **Related Skills**: Volunteer has similar capabilities
- **Experience Level**: Consider volunteer experience
- **Availability**: Check volunteer availability patterns

### Profile Optimization

**For Better Matching:**
- **Comprehensive Skills**: Include all relevant capabilities
- **Specific Categories**: Use detailed skill descriptions
- **Experience Levels**: Indicate years of experience
- **Availability**: Update availability regularly

**Administrative Best Practices:**
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review all volunteer profiles
- **Skill Updates**: Keep skill categories current
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor volunteer response rates
- **Feedback Integration**: Use volunteer feedback to improve matching

## Volunteer Self-Service

### Profile Access

**Volunteer Dashboard:**
- Volunteers can view their own profiles
- Access to personal information and skills
- View task history and assignments
- Update contact information

**Profile Limitations:**
- Volunteers cannot modify skill tags (admin only)
- Cannot change role assignments
- Limited to personal information updates
- Administrative oversight maintained

### Communication Preferences

**Email Notifications:**
- Volunteers receive task notifications automatically
- Can update email preferences in profile
- Notification frequency and timing
- Task type preferences
