### Role-Based Access Control

**Location Protection System:**
Your website implements sophisticated access control that selectively hides sensitive venue information based on user roles while maintaining public visibility for general event information.

**Access Level Implementation:**

| User Type | Event Information Access | Location Details |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Public Visitors** | Full event details (title, description, date, time) | "Become member to view" message |
| **Subscribers** | Full event details (title, description, date, time) | "Become member to view" message |
| **Members** | Complete event information | Full venue details, maps, addresses |
| **Volunteers** | Complete event information | Full venue details, maps, addresses |
| **Administrators** | Complete access to all features | Full venue details, maps, addresses |

**Protected Information:**
- Exact venue addresses and contact details
- Interactive maps and driving directions  
- Private meeting location specifics

**Public Information (Always Visible):**
- Event titles, dates, and times
- General descriptions and activities
- Event information and details
- General location area (e.g., "Bauline Community Area")

## Integration with WordPress User System
