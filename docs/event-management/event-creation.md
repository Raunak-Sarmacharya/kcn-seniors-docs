function kcn_add_category_classes_to_event($event, $EM_Event) {
    $terms = get_the_terms($EM_Event->post_id, 'event-categories');
    
    if (!empty($terms) && !is_wp_error($terms)) {
        $classes = [];
        foreach ($terms as $term) {
            $classes[] = 'event-category-' . sanitize_html_class($term->slug);
        }
        $event['className'] = array_merge($event['className'], $classes);
    }
    
    return $event;
}
```

## Recurring Events Best Practices

### Custom Dates vs. Standard Recurrence

Based on research and practical experience with EventPrime, **custom dates provide superior control and flexibility** compared to standard month/week recurrence options.

**Why Custom Dates Work Better:**

#### Standard Recurrence Limitations:
- **Month-based recurrence**: Can create scheduling conflicts with varying month lengths
- **Week-based recurrence**: May not account for holidays or special circumstances
- **Rigid scheduling**: Difficult to modify individual instances
- **Limited customization**: Cannot accommodate complex scheduling needs

#### Custom Dates Advantages:
- **Complete control**: Specify exact dates for each event occurrence
- **Flexibility**: Easy to skip dates for holidays or special circumstances
- **Individual modification**: Change specific instances without affecting the entire series
- **Complex patterns**: Create custom recurring patterns that don't fit standard options

### Implementing Custom Date Recurring Events

**EventPrime Custom Dates Process:**

1. **Create Master Event:**
   - Set up event with all standard information
   - Configure venue, description, and other details
   - Set the primary event date as the first occurrence

2. **Add Custom Dates:**
   - Use EventPrime's custom dates feature
   - Manually specify each occurrence date
   - Set individual times if events occur at different times

3. **Date Management:**
   - Add dates in chronological order for better organization
   - Include buffer time between events if needed
   - Account for holidays and organizational schedule

4. **Bulk Date Creation:**
   - Use EventPrime's bulk date tools when available
   - Copy patterns from existing recurring events
   - Plan seasonal or annual event schedules in advance

### Advanced Recurring Event Strategies

**Complex Scheduling Examples:**

**Monthly Meeting (Custom Dates):**
- Create specific dates for each month
- Skip months with holidays or conflicts
- Adjust for meeting room availability

**Seasonal Activities:**
- Plan entire seasons with custom dates
- Account for weather-dependent activities
- Build in makeup dates for outdoor events

**Annual Event Series:**
- Set up year-long event schedules
- Coordinate with community calendar
- Plan around major holidays and local events
